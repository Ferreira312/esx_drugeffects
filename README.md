# esx_drugeffects

Modifided version of esx_optionalneeds from @indilo53

[TODO]

-Instead of using the status valeu it needs to go to each drug. (for this i need to set somehow if item == weed then )
-Add the effects

[NOT WORKING YET !!!]

Adds the option to use drugs that adds effects ex. speed, damage reduction, health recharge.
This was made so you could buy or sell and have some reason to do it.
